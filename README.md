# EncounterBuilder
Easily create balanced D&amp;D Encounter spreadsheets from a huge database of foes.

> This application will provide the tools a DM needs to quickly customize their campaign by dragging and dropping monsters into an encounter and generating a .xlsx spreadsheet. Users can create their own monsters using the fields in the UI or can search the 5e Rest API via a search function.

> http://www.dnd5eapi.co/ is the source for the API. It allows for searching all the open-source content and returns the result as a JSON file. This JSON is parsed into a result and can be quickly added to the user's local save files.

> At the moment the project is far from complete. To checkout the Trello board for the project go to https://trello.com/b/prZ83kZO/enounter-builder.
